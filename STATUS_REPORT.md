# Game Framework Status Report

## Current State
After simplifying the game framework, we've successfully addressed the loading and module issues by creating a standalone implementation:

1. **Self-contained solution**: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file (index.html)
2. **Working games**: Both Dice Game and Card Game are functional
3. **Clean UI**: Responsive layout with betting controls and game display
4. **Simple server**: Made run-server.sh executable for easy local hosting
5. **Updated documentation**: README.md with clear instructions
6. **Organized codebase**: Moved unnecessary files to unused-files directory

## Architecture
The framework now uses a simplified architecture with three main components:

1. **State Management**: Handles game state, balance, and betting
2. **Canvas Manager**: Handles drawing, rendering, and animations 
3. **Game Manager**: Orchestrates game logic, UI interactions, and events

## Benefits of Simplified Approach
- **No loading errors**: Eliminated MIME type and module loading issues
- **Easy to understand**: All code in one place makes debugging simpler
- **Fast loading**: No external dependencies to load
- **Simple deployment**: Works by just opening the HTML file

## Potential Future Improvements

### Short-term
1. Add a simple high score system using localStorage
2. Implement sound effects for game events
3. Add animation transitions between games
4. Improve mobile responsiveness

### Medium-term
1. Add more games to showcase framework capabilities
2. Create a simple theme switcher
3. Add a game history feature
4. Implement local multiplayer functionality

### Long-term
1. Create a more robust component architecture if needed
2. Add a proper build system for code organization while maintaining the single-file output
3. Consider adding minimal external dependencies for enhanced visuals if needed
4. Develop a plugin system for extending games
