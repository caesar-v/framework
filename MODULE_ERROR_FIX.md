# Module Error Fix

This document explains fixes for the module loading error: "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"."

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Element Reference**: Fixed `gameTitle` element selector in test.js to look for either `.game-title` or `.portal-title` class.

2. **Module Loading Error**: Added a debugging utility that monitors script loading and prevents ES module loading attempts that could cause errors.

3. **Missing content.bundle.js**: Created a stub file that satisfies any requests for this file without errors.

4. **Server MIME Type Configuration**: Added .htaccess file to ensure JavaScript files are served with the correct MIME type.

## How the Fix Works

The debugging utility (`debugModuleLoader.js`) monitors script creation and detects when scripts are being added with `type="module"`. It intercepts these attempts and converts them to regular scripts to prevent errors.

The stub `content.bundle.js` file prevents 404 errors when this file is requested by tests or the PIXI library.

## Technical Details

1. The main issue was likely related to removing PIXI from the framework while some components were still trying to load PIXI-related resources as ES modules.

2. Dynamic script loading in the test framework was looking for elements that were renamed (e.g., `.game-title` to `.portal-title`).

3. The server may not have been configured to serve JavaScript files with the correct MIME type for ES modules.

## Future Recommendations

1. When removing libraries like PIXI, ensure all related dependencies are also updated or removed.

2. Consider switching to a modern module bundler like Webpack or Rollup for better module handling.

3. Keep the `debugModuleLoader.js` in place during development to catch any future module loading issues.
